  <h3>Majors</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The mathematics curriculum provides a rigorous foundation in theoretical and applied mathematics.</li>
    <li>The computer science curriculum provides a broad overview of computer science as a discipline and gives the student essential technical and analytical skills.</li>
    <li>The data science curriculum weaves together traditional curriculum in statistics, mathematics and computer science along with curriculum related to current data science techniques.</li>
    <li>The cybersecurity curriculum, in concert with the core curriculum, helps fulfill the undergraduate mission of the university by preparing students for challenging and meaningful careers that aid in cyber defense.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Double Majors</h3>
    <p>A unique aspect to our programs is the ability to double major without overloading semesters. There is overlap between content of the programs and several courses can be double counted. For a student who majors in two of our programs, the number of credits in any given semester is at most 16. Students can double major in: Computer Science and Cybersecurity (64 credits), Computer Science and Data Science (65 credits), Data Science and Mathematics (65 credits), Data Science and Cybersecurity (67 credits), Computer Science and Mathematics (69 credits).</p>
